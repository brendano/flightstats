On-time flight performance - very simple historical analysis and website.
http://brenocon.com/flightstats

To access the calculated data (which gets turned into the website), see the
summary_data/ directory.

To re-run the analysis and build the website:

1. Manually download CSVs from the BTS website. About 50-100MB per month (unzipped).
2. install the right R libraries
3. ./build.sh  ==>  results in summary_data/ and html/.

Flights CSVs from BTS are in the data/ directory (~1 GB total)

In the rank_*.csv files, the "_raw" columns are the simple averages;
without the "_raw" is the Agresti-Coull upper-bound estimate.


Updating the data:

Each month was manually downloaded from
http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236
into the data/ directory.
need to select the columns that stuff.r uses.

i added year/months to the CSV spreadsheet names, though that's not important
for the analyzer.
