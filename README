On-time flight performance - very simple historical analysis and website.
http://brenocon.com/flightstats

To access the calculated data (which gets turned into the website), see the
summary_data/ directory.

To re-run the analysis and build the website:

1. Manually download CSVs from the BTS website into data/.
2. install the right R libraries
3. ./build.sh  ==>  results in summary_data/ and html/.

Flights CSVs from BTS go to the data/ directory (~1 GB total).
I put a copy here: http://brenocon.com/flightstats/bts_data_201406-201506.zip
On my machine "ls -l" currently looks like this. (the sizes are nonuniform
because different columns were selected)

Updating the data:

Each month was manually downloaded from
http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236
into the data/ directory.
need to select the columns that stuff.r uses.

I added year/months to the CSV spreadsheet names, though that's not important
for the analyzer.
